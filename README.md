## Introduction

With the rising importance of Cloud deployment, organizations face the intricate task of optimally deploying component-based applications on diverse Virtual Machine (VM) offerings. While robust solutions like Kubernetes and AWS Elastic Beanstalk exist, they don't target this specific challenge efficiently.

This project introduces a unique approach combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the SMT solver Z3. Leveraging GNNs' capability to interpret graph-structured data, we model past deployments as graphs, enabling the prediction of optimal VM assignments based on historical data.

By using these GNN-based predictions as soft constraints in Z3, we enhance search efficiency, making the deployment process both more efficient and cost-effective.


## Features

1. **Dataset Generation:** 
   - Generate a dataset to train the GNN model for the application deployment.
   - For a detailed look into the data generation process: ðŸ”— [src/generate_dataset](./src/generate_dataset.py)

2. **GNN Model Implementation:**
   - Construct and train the GNN model able to predict component-to-VM assignments and VM Offer types.
   - Save trained model for future use.
   - Explore the implementation: ðŸ”— [src/main](./src/main.py)
   - ðŸ”— Saved Model: [src/trained_model_SecureWeb_DO.pth](./src/trained_model_SecureWeb_DO.pth)

3. **Integration with SMT Solver Z3:**
   - Transform GNN predictions into soft constraints.
   - Guide the Z3 solver towards an optimal solution using these constraints.
   - See: ðŸ”— [src/Wrapper_GNN_Z3](./src/Wrapper_GNN_Z3.py)


    ```python
    def add_pred_soft_constraints(solver, prediction):
    # prediction is a matrix of size (nr comp) * (nr vms * nr offers)
    constraints = []
    nrOffers = solver.nrOffers
    nrVms = solver.nrVM
    nrComponents = solver.nrComp
    for comp_idx in range(nrComponents):
        pred_comp = prediction[comp_idx]
        matrix = np.reshape(pred_comp, (nrOffers, nrVms))
        for vm_idx in range(solver.nrVM):
            pred_comp_vm = matrix[:, vm_idx]
            placements = [i for i, x
                            in enumerate(pred_comp_vm)
                            if x == 1]
            a_matrix_index = comp_idx * solver.nrVM + vm_idx
            if len(placements) != 0:
                constraints.append(solver.a[a_matrix_index] == 1)
            else:
                constraints.append(solver.a[a_matrix_index] == 0)
            for placement in placements:
                vmType = placement + 1
                constraints.append(solver.vmType[vm_idx] == vmType)
    constraints = list(set(constraints))
    solver.solver.add_soft(constraints)
    ```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SAGE-Project/SAGE-GNN.git
