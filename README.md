## Introduction

With the rising importance of Cloud deployment, organizations face the intricate task of optimally deploying component-based applications on diverse Virtual Machine (VM) offerings. While robust solutions like Kubernetes and AWS Elastic Beanstalk exist, they don't target this specific challenge efficiently.

This project introduces a unique approach combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the SMT solver Z3. Leveraging GNNs' capability to interpret graph-structured data, we model past deployments as graphs, enabling the prediction of optimal VM assignments based on historical data.

By using these GNN-based predictions as soft constraints in Z3, we enhance search efficiency, making the deployment process both more efficient and cost-effective in many cases.

This repository accompanies the paper *Neuro-Symbolic Constrained Optimization for Cloud Application Deployment via Graph Neural Networks and Satisfiability Modulo Theory* submitted to  [Constraints](https://link.springer.com/journal/10601) journal. 


## Features

1. **Dataset Generation:** 
   - Generate a dataset to train the GNN model for the application deployment.
   - For a detailed look into the data generation process run: ðŸ”— [src/generate_dataset.py](./src/generate_dataset.py)

2. **GNN Model Implementation:**
   - Construct and train the GNN model able to predict component-to-VM assignments and VM Offer types.
   - Save trained model for future use.
   - Explore the implementation: ðŸ”— [src/trainRGCN.py](./src/trainRGCN.py)
   - ðŸ”— Saved Model: [Models/GNNs/Models_20_7_Datasets-improved-Gini/Models_20_7_SecureBillingEmail-improved-Gini/model_RGCN_1000_samples_100_epochs_32_batchsize.pth](./Models/GNNs/Models_20_7_Datasets-improved-Gini/Models_20_7_SecureWebContainer-improved-Gini/model_RGCN_1000_samples_100_epochs_32_batchsize.pth)

3. **Integration with SMT Solver Z3:**
   - Transform GNN predictions into soft constraints.
   - Guide the Z3 solver towards an optimal solution using these constraints.
   - See: ðŸ”— [src/Wrapper_GNN_Z3.py](./src/Wrapper_GNN_Z3.py)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SAGE-Project/SAGE-GNN.git
cd SAGE-GNN
```

### 2. Setting Up a Conda Environment

- First, make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system.

- **Create a new environment** (replace "myenv" with your desired environment name):

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
```

- **Activate the environment**:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project relies on the following open-source libraries and tools:

- **Python (v3.10)**
- **Deep Graph Library (DGL v0.91)**
- **PyTorch (v1.13.0)**
- **CUDA (v11.6)**

Please ensure you have these dependencies installed and configured correctly before running the project.

## Usage

Using the already trained GNN models ([Models/GNNs](Models/GNNs/)) and an application description ([Models/json](Models/json/)) **compare** the results between:
   - Base solver, and
   - Base solver augumented with softconstraints extracted from the GNN (Base solver + GNN),
   - See: ðŸ”— [src/comparison.py](./src/comparison.py). 
   - The output are SMT-LIB files describing a constraint optimization problem together with the solution. See: [Output/SMT-LIB/SecureWebContainer](Output/SMT-LIB/SecureWebContainer)

Additionally, statistics can be run to answer the following research questions:
   - **RQ1**: How does scalability of the hybrid approach vary with the number of available VM Offers and with increasing number of component instances which also changes the dynamics of component interactions? See: [utils/RQ1/scalability_GNN_offers.py](utils/RQ1/scalability_GNN_offers.py)
   - **RQ2**: Is there a correlation between the GNN predictions and the optimal solution? Furthermore, is there a relationship between solution time and the optimal solution? See: [utils/RQ2/price-optimality.py](utils/RQ2/price-optimality.py)
   - **RQ3**: Are there specific GNNs tailored for particular use cases that simultaneously predict well the assignments of components to VMs while minimizing execution time and achieving optimal solution? See: [utils/RQ3/readme](utils/RQ3/readme)
